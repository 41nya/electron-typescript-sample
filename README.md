## electron-typescript-sample
This project is a so simple sample using Electron, TypeScript and webpack. This project was created by the following procedure.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev electron
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```
After this, I created webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json, src/index.html, and src/index.ts.

## Usage 
```bash 
# installation
npm install

# building
npm run build

# running
npm run start

```
